// 1. To go on the Super Dooper Looper roller coaster you have to be equal or above 150cm
// 2. Use an if/else statement to log "You can go on the ride" if the variable height is equal or above 150 or "Sorry you are not tall enough" height is below 150
// 3. Modify your if statement so that if height is not a number the message "Please enter a number" is logged to the console

let height = 150;

if(height === 150){

} else if (height > 150){
